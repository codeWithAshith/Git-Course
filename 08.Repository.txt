* To clone a repository 
  * git clone <sshUrl>

* If we have a change in local and remote repository, we cannot push unless we update the code from remote to local repository
* We can update the same using two ways
  * git pull -> the copy of the remote directory changes into the local repository
  * git fetch ->  tells the local repository that there are changes available in the remote repository without bringing the changes into the local repository

* To set remote origin after updating the name from github
  * git remote set-url origin <sshUrl>
